### Session Aim

To provide an overview of Chaos Engineering and discuss how it can be applied to SQL Server

---

### What is Chaos Engineering?

@quote[Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.](principlesofchaos.org)

---

### How does it work?

---

### Past Incident Analysis

---

### Define your system

---

### Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)

@quote[Begun in the 1940s by the U.S. military, failure modes and effects analysis is a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, process, product, or service.](asq.org/quality-resources/fmea)
