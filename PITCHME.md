### Session Aim

To provide an overview of Chaos Engineering and discuss how it can be applied to SQL Server

---

### Agenda

Chaos Engineering Definition<br>
Apply Chaos Engineering to SQL Server<br>
Running a Chaos Engineering experiment<br>
Tools for Chaos Engineering<br>

---

@quote[Chaos Monkey is responsible for randomly terminating instances in production to ensure that engineers implement their services to be resilient to instance failures.](netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/)

### What is Chaos Engineering?

@quote[Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.](principlesofchaos.org)

### What Chaos Engineering is not!

@ul
- Breaking things in production!<br>
- Staging or Production?<br>
- Blast Radius<br>
- Fallout

# Getting Started

---

### Define your systems

@ul
- Infrastructure<br>
    - Cloud, private data centre?
- Applications<br>
    - What's hitting our SQL instances?
- Monitoring<br>
    - How are we going to analyse the results of our experiments?
@ulend
---

### Past Incident Analysis

How has the system failed previously?<br>
What technologies/strategies are in place to minimise impact?<br>
What was learnt from those previous failures?<br>

---

### Likelihood-Impact Map

</p>

---

### Scientific Method

@ol[](false)
1. Observation
2. Declaration of the end goal or issue
3. Forming a hypothesis
4. Testing the hypothesis
5. Analysis of results
6. Conclusion
@olend

---

### Defining an experiment

Which failure has the likelihood?<br>
Which failure has the highest impact?<br>
What will you gain from testing that failure?<br>
Is there anything else that can be tested?<br>
Experiment can be performed manually or scripted<br>
Organise a time slot to perform the experiment<br>

---

### Running the experiment

Who needs to be involved?<br>
Active participants vs Observers<br>
Have a saftey monitor<br>
Communicate!

# Applying to SQL Server

---

### Before you go any further!

@ul
- Check your backups!<br>
- What is your restore strategy?<br>
- High availability<br>
- Diaster Recovery
@ulend

---

### What failure are we going to test?

@ul
- What happens if a node in a Availbility Group cluster fails?
@ulend

---

### Defining the experiment

@ul
- Hypothesis
    - The listener of the availbility group should be online
- Method
    - Stop the SQL database engine service on the primary node
- Rollback
    - Restart the SQL database engine service on the primary node
