### Session Aim

To provide an overview of Chaos Engineering and discuss how it can be applied to SQL Server

---

### Agenda

Chaos Engineering Definition
Apply Chaos Engineering to SQL Server
Running a Chaos Engineering experiment
Tools for Chaos Engineering

---

## Chaos Engineering

---

### What is Chaos Engineering?

@quote[Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.](principlesofchaos.org)

---

### What Chaos Engineering is not!

Breaking things in production!

---

### Staging or Production?

Blast Radius
Fallout

---

### How does it work?

Scientific Method

1) Observation
2) Declaration of the end goal or issue
3) Forming a hypothesis
4) Testing the hypothesis
5) Analysis of results
6) Conclusion
7) Further research

---

### Define your system

Infrastructure
Applications
Monitoring

---

### Past Incident Analysis

How has the system failed previously?
What technologies/strategies are in place to minimise impact?
What was learnt from those previous failures?

---

### Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)

@quote[Begun in the 1940s by the U.S. military, failure modes and effects analysis is a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, process, product, or service.](asq.org/quality-resources/fmea)

### Likelihood-Impact Map

---

### Defining an experiment

Which failure has the highest failure likelihood and impact?
What will you gain from testing that failure?
Is there anything else that can be tested?
Experiment can be performed manually or scripted
Organise a time slot to perform the experiment

---

### Running the experiment

Who needs to be involved?
Active participants vs Observers
Have a saftey monitor
Communicate!

---

## Applying to SQL Server

---

### Pre-requisities

Before you go any further!

---

### High availability

---

### Diaster Recovery

---

### Defining the first experiment

---

### Demo

---

### Chaos Engineering Tools

---

### Netflix - Chaos Monkey

@quote[Chaos Monkey is responsible for randomly terminating instances in production to ensure that engineers implement their services to be resilient to instance failures.](netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/)
